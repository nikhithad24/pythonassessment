amazon_product_detail_description: 'A Wharton professor and tech entrepreneur examines
  how algorithms and artificial intelligence are starting to run every aspect of our
  lives, and how we can shape the way they impact us


  Through the technology embedded in almost every major tech platform and every web-enabled
  device, algorithms and the artificial intelligence that underlies them make a staggering
  number of everyday decisions for us, from what products we buy, to where we decide
  to eat, to how we consume our news, to whom we date, and how we find a job. We''ve
  even delegated life-and-death decisions to algorithms--decisions once made by doctors,
  pilots, and judges. In his new book, Kartik Hosanagar surveys the brave new world
  of algorithmic decision-making and reveals the potentially dangerous biases they
  can give rise to as they increasingly run our lives. He makes the compelling case
  that we need to arm ourselves with a better, deeper, more nuanced understanding
  of the phenomenon of algorithmic thinking. And he gives us a route in, pointing
  out that algorithms often think a lot like their creators--that is, like you and
  me.


  Hosanagar draws on his experiences designing algorithms professionally--as well
  as on history, computer science, and psychology--to explore how algorithms work
  and why they occasionally go rogue, what drives our trust in them, and the many
  ramifications of algorithmic decision-making. He examines episodes like Microsoft''s
  chatbot Tay, which was designed to converse on social media like a teenage girl,
  but instead turned sexist and racist; the fatal accidents of self-driving cars;
  and even our own common, and often frustrating, experiences on services like Netflix
  and Amazon. A Human''s Guide to Machine Intelligence is an entertaining and provocative
  look at one of the most important developments of our time and a practical user''s
  guide to this first wave of practical artificial intelligence.'
